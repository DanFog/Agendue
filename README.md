## Agendue
-------------------

Agendue is a web-based group project management tool. It has the ability to do the following:
* Track group projects
* Keep analytics on projects
* Act as a message board for groups
* Manage individual and group tasks
* Interface with Android and iOS client applications

Agendue consists of 3 components: web (Ruby on Rails), Android, and iOS.

The web component has a Bootstrap-based frontend and a JSON API. It integrates with Stripe for payments, Mandrill for emails, Apple Push Notifications, Google Cloud Messaging, Web calendars, and Facebook and Google oAuth providers.

Agendue was an active project from spring 2013 to summer 2015. It was finally shut down in May 2015. The applications are still live on the respective app stores, but the iOS app will likely be taken down soon. The entire project has been made open source, but the commit history has been purged to remove any personally identifiable information.
