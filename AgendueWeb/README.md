## Agendue Web
-------------------

This is the Ruby on Rails web application for Agendue. It provides a Ruby on Rails app, a Bootstrap-based frontend, and a JSON API.

Agendue has the ability to do the following:
* Track group projects
* Keep analytics on projects
* Act as a message board for groups
* Manage individual and group tasks
* Interface with Android and iOS client applications

To get started, you will need Ruby, Rails, and SQLite (it is easily configured to work with MySQL as well). Once the repo has been cloned, run 
```
bundle install

```
 to get started. You will need to put any configuration information into the "config" folder.
